            This tool (seqdb_config_maker) is packaged as part of seqdb-py distribution.
            
            This dependency definition creates a virtual environment (virtualenv) and installs seqdb-py into the virtual environment directly from bitbucket.
            
            Required Galaxy packages: python-devel
            
            After the tool is installed, need to create a config.yaml with the local install information:
            - In the install directory (typically "path to install/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages"), go to config directory
            - Rename config.yaml.sample to config.yaml
            - Modify config.yaml according to instruction inside
            - cp config.yaml /galaxy/database/job_working_directory/000/config.yaml
            
            
            The tool can then be executed by running:
            
            seqdb_config_maker
            
            which is defined as an entry point to seqdb-py distribution and can be executed from any system location.
