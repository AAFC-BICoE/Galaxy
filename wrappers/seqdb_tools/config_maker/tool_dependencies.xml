            This dependency definition creates a virtual environment (virtualenv) and installs seqdb-py into the virtual environment directly from bitbucket. The tool can then be executed by running:
            
            seqdb_config_maker
            
            which is defined as an entry point to seqdb-py and can be executed from any system location.
