            This is seqdb-py distribution, which contains a number of SeqDB tools.
            
            This dependency definition creates a virtual environment (virtualenv) and installs seqdb-py into the virtual environment directly from bitbucket.
            
            Required Galaxy packages: python-devel
            
            After the tool is installed, need to create a config.yaml with the local install information:
            - In the install directory (typically "installlocation"/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages"), go to config directory
            - Rename config.yaml.sample to config.yaml
            - Modify config.yaml according to instruction inside
            - Copy config.yaml to the job working directory:
               cp config.yaml /galaxy/database/job_working_directory/000/config.yaml
            
            
            The tools in seqdb-py can then be executed by running their distribution entry point (see setup.py for details). Example of executing a pull sequences tool:
            
            pull_seqdb_seqs
