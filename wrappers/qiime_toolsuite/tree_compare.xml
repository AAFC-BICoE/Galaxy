	<help>Compares jackknifed/bootstrapped trees (support trees) with a master tree constructed typically from the entire dataset (e.g: a resulting file from upgma_cluster.py) and outputs support for nodes.

if support trees do not have all tips that master has (e.g. because samples with few sequences were dropped during a jackknifing analysis), the output master tree will have only those tips included in all support trees

if support trees have tips that the master tree does not, those tips will be ignored (removed from the support tree during analysis)
The result of tree_compare.py contains the master tree, now with internal nodes uniquely named, a separate bootstrap/jackknife support file, listing the support for each internal node, and a jackknife_named_nodes.tre tree, where internal nodes are named with their support values from 0 to 1.0, for use with tree visualization software (e.g. FigTree).</help>
