This script exports, downloads, and saves a mapping file that is stored
remotely. Currently, the only type of remote mapping file that is supported is
a Google Spreadsheet, though other methods of remote storage may be supported
in the future.

For more information and examples pertaining to this script and remote mapping
files in general, please refer to the accompanying tutorial, which can be found
at http://qiime.org/tutorials/remote_mapping_files.html.


The script outputs a single file, which is the metadata mapping file obtained
from the remote location (in QIIME-compatible format).
