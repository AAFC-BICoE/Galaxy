This script compares two taxa summary files by computing the correlation
coefficient between pairs of samples. This is useful, for example, if you want
to compare the taxonomic composition of mock communities that were assigned
using different taxonomy assigners in order to see if they are correlated or
not. Another example use-case is to compare the taxonomic composition of
several mock community replicate samples to a single expected, or known, sample
community.

This script is also useful for sorting and filling taxa summary files so that
each sample has the same taxa listed in the same order (with missing taxa
reporting an abundance of zero). The sorted and filled taxa summary files can
then be passed to a script, such as plot_taxa_summary.py, to visually compare
the differences using the same taxa coloring scheme.

For more information and examples pertaining to this script, please refer to
the accompanying tutorial, which can be found at
http://qiime.org/tutorials/taxa_summary_comparison.html.


The script will always output at least three files to the specified output
directory. Two files will be the sorted and filled versions of the input taxa
summary files, which can then be used in plot_taxa_summary.py to visualize the
differences in taxonomic composition. These files will be named based on the
basename of the input files. If the input files' basenames are the same, the
output files will have '0' and '1' appended to their names to keep the
filenames unique. The first input taxa summary file will have '0' in its
filename and the second input taxa summary file will have '1' in its filename.

The third output file will contain the results of the overall comparison of the
input taxa summary files using the specified sample pairings. The correlation
coefficient, parametric p-value, nonparametric p-value, and a confidence
interval for the correlation coefficient will be included.

If --perform_detailed_comparisons is specified, the fourth output file is a
tab-separated file containing the correlation coefficients that were computed
between each of the paired samples. Each line will contain the sample IDs of
the samples that were compared, followed by the correlation coefficient that
was computed, followed by the parametric and nonparametric p-values
(uncorrrected and Bonferroni-corrected) and a confidence interval for the
correlation coefficient.

The output files will contain comments at the top explaining the types of tests
that were performed.
