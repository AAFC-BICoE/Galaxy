Provides a BLAST tool dependency for galaxy. Does not actually install any galaxy tools.

This is editted from the package_blast_plus_2_2_26 from the central toolshed to use the legacy blast tools primarily for some mothur tools.

This dependency will attempt to build the correct version for your OS and continue only if at least one succeeds.
