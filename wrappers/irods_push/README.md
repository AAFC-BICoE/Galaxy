There are two options for Exporting files:

-using an absolute directory path (, looking for better name for this) 
-getting existing directory paths based on directory depth typed so far based on your user home directory. The user home
directory generally looks like this: <yourzone>/home/<yourusername>. If I were to type in a directory depth of 1, I would get 
just the user home directory, depth of 2 is all the directories within the user home directory and the user home directory and it
goes on like that.
