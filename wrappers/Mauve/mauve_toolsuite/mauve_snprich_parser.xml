**Description**

Parses a Mauve SNP and alignment files to parse out alignments of SNP rich regions.  This tool provides the option to define how many SNPs in specific region length translates to SNP-rich region.  In addition, you can opt to eliminate Mauve&#39;s interpretation of ambiguous bases as SNPs.

SNP Rich Regions are identified based on finding a specific number of contiguous base pairs where a specific number of SNPs are located. 

Consider the following alignment of 20 base pairs:

BP         1                  19
Genome 1   AAACCCCTTTTGGGGGAAAA
Genome 2   AAAGCCATATTCGGAGAAAA
           ~~~ ~~ ~ ~~ ~~ ~~~~~

By specifying to look for regions of length upto 6 base pairs long with a minimum of 3 SNPs, then the whole alignment is included as containing a SNP rich region where there is a region that is at most 6 base pairs and contains 3 SNPs.

By specifying to generate a Primer3 input file to create flanking sequencing primer pairs, the following regions are targeted: bases 4-9 and 7-12

By specifying to ignore overlapping regions with the same parameters as above, only the first 6 base pair region (bases 4 to 9) is targeted by Primer3.


**Inputs and Outputs**

-Inputs
	-mauve snp file
		Provide the Mauve SNP File path.  This file is typically produced by Mauve&#39;s find-snps script that produces a tab-formatter output.
	-mauve alignment file
		Provide the mauve alignment file path. This file is in XMFA format by default. Other formats are not accepted by this tool.

-Outputs
 	-Alignment File
		This alignment file contains a subset of the input alignment file where the included alignments contain one or more SNP Rich regions. The alignment format can be modified by the optional parameters below.

	-Primer3 Input File
		A Primer3 input file that can be passed to primer3 to generate sequencing primers for SNP rich regions.  This file is only generated if requested.

**Parameters**

  -alignment format
    Define the output alignment format to use.  See PerlDoc on Bio::AlignIO for supported output formats.  Some supported formats are xmfa, clustalw, fasta, phylip.
  -SNP count
    Define if an alignment is kept based on the minimum number of SNPs found in a region length.  Specify a region length of 0 to simply include all alignments with the specific snp-count.
  -SNP Region Length
    Define if an alignment is kept based on the SNP count within the defined region length.
  -Trim 5 prime end
    Ignore the first X number of bases from the 5-prime end of the alignment where mauve inaccurately detects many SNPs. Set to 0 to include all bases.
  -Trim 3 prime end
    Ignore the last X number of bases from the 3-prime end of the alignment where mauve inaccurately detects many SNPs. Set to 0 to include all bases.
  -Ignore Ambiguous SNPs
    Ignore SNPs detected by mauve that include &#39;N&#39; bases.
  -Create a Primer3 file for Sequencing Primers
    Generates a Primer3 input file that requests Primer3 to generate primer pairs that flank SNP Rich Regions
  -No Overlapping Regions
    This option eliminates overlapping regions from the Primer3 target list.  Hence, the SNP rich regions identified are not overlapping.
