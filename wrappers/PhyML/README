PhyML Galaxy Wrapper

This repository contains a Galaxy tool wrapper for the PhyML program, which estimates the maximum likelihood phylogenies from alignments of nucleotide or amino acide sequences. 

PhyML has been developed within the PhyML Development Team at ATGC Montpellier Bioinformatics platform (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/)

The reference for PhyML is:
	- Guindon S., Dufayard J.F., Lefort V., Anisimova M., Hordijk W., & Gascuel O. (2010). New Alogirthms and Methods to Estimate Maximum-Likelihood Phylogenies: Assessing the Performance of PhyML 		3.0. System Biology, 59(3):307-21.

The PhyML Tool Suite repository:
	- Provides PhyML wrapper for the PhyML tool
	- Downloads and installs PhyML on the Linux operating system

Requirements:
	- Virtual Machine
	- Galaxy
	- Galaxy Tool Shed 

Installation via the Galaxy Tool Shed to install the tool wrapper and the PhyML program:<
1- Start your virtual environment

2- Create a category on your local Tool Shed called PhyML

3- In that category, you need to create two repositories on your local Tool Shed:
	- Name: phyml, Type: Unristricted Repository
	- Name: package_phyml_3_1, Type: Tool Dependency Repository

4- For the repository package_phyml_3_1, you need to upload the file tool_dependencies.xml (located in wrappers/PhyML/package_phyml_3_1). This file wile will take care of installing PhyML.

5- For the repository phyml, you need to upload two files called phyml_wrapper.xml and tool_dependencies.xml (located in wrappers/PhyML/phyml). But before you upload these files, some changes must be made for the wrappers/PhyML/phyml/tool_dependencies.xml. 
	- Change the toolshed attribute to match your hostname
		<repository name="package_phyml_3_1 owner="galaxyuser" toolshed="http://yourmachinename.agr.gc.ca:9009" ... />

	- Change the changeset_revision to match the revision of the package_phyml_3_1 repository
		<repository name="package_phyml_3_1 owner="galaxyuser" toolshed="http://yourmachinename.agr.gc.ca:9009" changeset_revision="revision of package_phyml_3_1" />
	

6- Go to your local Galaxy instance, Admin -> Search and Browse Tool Sheds -> Local Tool Shed -> PhyML. You can now install PhyML and run the tool.
