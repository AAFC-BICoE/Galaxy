PhyML is a software package that estimates the maximum likelihood phylogenies from alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. 

The PhyML Tool Suite repository:
	- Provides PhyML wrapper for the PhyML tool
	- Downloads and installs PhyML on the Linux operating system

Requirements:
	- phyml 

Repository Dependency:
	- PhyML version 3.1 (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/download.php)
	- The repository name is package_phyml_3_1

On local ToolShed, create two repositories:
	- phyml (Unrestricted Repository)
	- package_phyml_3_1 (Tool Dependency Repository)

First, for the package_phyml_3_1, upload the file called tool_dependencies.xml. This file will automatically install PhyML v.3.1 on Galaxy.
Second, for the phyml repository, upload phyml_wrapper.xml and tool_dependencies.xml.
Some changes need to be made to phyml/tool_dependencies.xml before uploading:
	- Change the toolshed attribute to match your hostname.
	- Change the changeset_revision to match the revision of the package_phyml_3_1/tool_dependencies.xml once this file was uploaded. 

You can now install PhyML on your local Galaxy, and run the tool.
